# python-api-challenge

##WeatherPy##
*First, a list of cities was generated to for this analysis. This was performed using np.random and citipy.
*Next, an API request was generated to openweathermap to generate weather conditions for all of the cities. 
*The cities information was then converted into a DataFrame. 
*DataFrame was exported to a directory as a csv file. 
*Scatter plots were created to show the following relationships:
1. Latitude Vs. Temperature
2. Latitude Vs. Humidity
3. Latitude Vs. Cloudiness
4. Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot
*Linear regression were calculated and plotten on the relationships above.

##VacationPy##
*First, the csv file created in weatherpy was created into a DataFrame for this analysis.
*A map was then created to display a point on each city. The size of the point was calculated based on the city's humidity.
*Ideal conditions were then used to narrow down the cities for the updated DataFrame. 
*Hotel_df was created to house the hotels in the cities.
